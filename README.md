# DiceRollerApp
I have created this app using, KOTLIN.This, works as other dice roller works, have same functionality.
but, the intresting thing of my project is, it shows the no on the dice, i.e. as it comes 6 then it shows the side of the dice, which has 6 sides.
This, is the app of dice rolling that, i have created by my own. And, further will be making it more intractive
